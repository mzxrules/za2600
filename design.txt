== World Tiles ==
The overworld seems to need more PF2 strips than PF1
Due to the 2 char overlap, PF1 for full 4x2 room sprites tend to be all 0s
Thus to better utilize the room sprite sheet, double the room tile budget to
16 bits, over 3 bytes

Playfield sprites are 16 pixels tall (16 bytes), thus a pointer could be calculated as

    SpritePtr + (spriteId * 16)

We can pre-compute the mul 16 by storing the 4 least significant bits of the
sprite index in the upper 4, and the most significant 1-2 bits in the lower
1-2 bits. Thus, AND #$F0 gives the pointer's least significant byte, then
AND #$01/#$03 + #>SpritePtr gives the most significant byte.

Door Flags: xxxx 111x  >> 1
            xxxx 111x  << 4
            xxxx 11xx  << 1

== Door and Wall Flags ==
These configure the openings and behaviors for the room's NSEW exits.

The level editor and game implementations differ slightly.
In the level editor, the door flags for a world bank are split into NSEW arrays,
with each byte representing one room's door flags for that particular wall.
This value is a 3 bit maximum enumeration.

When building the game, the enumeration is split into two bytes:
    roomDoors (door flags), which is packed with PF data
    roomWA

both bytes have the same general allocation shown below:

N xxxx xx11
S xxxx 11xx
E xx11 xxxx
W 11xx xxxx

  Zero Capture Shift Masks
N 0xFC  0x03     0
S 0xF3  0x0C     2
E 0xCF  0x30     4
W 0x3F  0xC0     6

The behavior of door and wall flags depends on whether the current world bank
is an overworld or a dungeon.

Overworld flags:

E   D   W   Wall Type
0  00   0 = None
1  00   1 = Middle
2  01   0 = Wall with 4 pixel centered opening
3  01   1 = Full Wall
4  10   0 = Wall with top or left open
5  10   1 = Wall with bottom or right open
6  11   0 = Wall with 16 pixel centered open (NS only)
7  11   1 = Unused

Dungeon flags:
The door flags have been optimized for dungeons, and directly correspond to how
the wall openings will be drawn.

E   W   D
0  00  00 = open
1  00  01 = keydoor
2  00  10 = shutter door
3  00  11 = wall
4  10  11 = bombable wall
5  11  11 = false wall

== Legacy keydoor id system considered during 4k days ===

Zero mask used to ID keydoor unlocked flag
Unlock flag lookup table:
RoomA, RoomB, MaskA, MaskB

RoomA is south or east only
RoomB is north or west only

The above is rather complex. Gonna scrap that for keydoors at least
Instead, RAM banks 1-3 store room flags

== Room Special ==
RF_PF_IGNORE disables playfield collision within room center
 Enabled in all rooms with PF2 Triforce design
RF_PF_AXIS allows the player to walk over playfield with boots
 Enabled in dungeon rooms with RED or WATER colors

ClearDrop System:

Two slots: A, B
Stairs / Key Items, Random Item Drops

RoomScript configures A, EnemySystem configures B
RoomScript will wait for enType to be #EnClearDrop

On EnSysEnDie, set enType to #EN_NONE
Set cdBX/cdBY to enX/enY


The ClearDrop system will init the rest of the system on #RF_EV_ENCLEAR

If enType == #EN_NONE and (roomFlags & (#RF_EV_ENCLEAR or #RF_EV_CLEAR))
    set enType to #EnClearDrop
    zero enState, cdBTimer, cdAType, cdBType
    if #RF_EV_ENCLEAR
        set cdBType #CD_ITEM_RAND

EnClearDrop:
    Process previous frame's collision
         if #CD_LAST_UPDATE indexes an inactive actor, skip

    Set CD_UPDATE_A, CD_UPDATE_B based on cdA/BType being non-zero

    if CD_UPDATE_A, CD_UPDATE_B == 0 rts

    if CD_UPDATE_A, not CD_UPDATE_B, run CD_UPDATE_A x == 1

    if not CD_UPDATE_A, CD_UPDATE_B, run CD_UPDATE_B x == 1

    if CD_UPDATE_A and CD_UPDATE_B
        a = Frame & 1
        if a == 0, run CD_UPDATE_A, x == 2
        else run CD_UPDATE_B, x == 2

Additionally, the ItemGet system allows for Link to hold items above his head.
Affects EnClearDrop and EnShopkeeper var allocation
enState stores ItemGet trigger, for restoring EnClearDrop and playing MS
cdAType stores GiItem to hold overhead

Enemy Spawn Routine:

PF1L is normal, so bit 0x80 is left, 0x01 is toward center
PF2 is mirrored, so bit 0x80 is center, 0x01 is left/right
PF1R is "mirrored" so bit 0x80 is right, 0x01 is toward center
PF is 4 units per bit, 0x40 is center x, 0x48 is top, 0x10 is bottom ("2x2" sprites)
With standard "2x2" sprites We can force PF2 spawns to only be on the "grid",
using these bit patterns:

0x80 -> x = +-0x00 + 0x40
0x60 -> x = +-0x08 + 0x40
0x18 -> x = +-0x10 + 0x40
0x06 -> x = +-0x18 + 0x40

4 PF2 checks

for y component:

0 = 0x14
1 = 0x1C
2 = 0x24
3 = 0x2C
4 = 0x34
5 = 0x3C
6 = 0x44

Vertically, I think I want to avoid spawning enemies on the first/last pf line;
this gives us 13 possible vertical spawn positions, 7 if we do "on grid" spawns

In total, that's 28 PF2 spawn points

For PF1 spawns, these bit patterns are "on grid"

0x06 -> x = +-0x28 + 0x40
0x18 -> x = +-0x30 + 0x40

That's 14 PF1 spawn points, or 28 total

Together, it makes 56 spawn checks

Algo time!

8 x pos, 7 y pos: 3 bits x, 3 bits y

x bits:

0?? PF2 check
0xx PF2 check type
1?? PF1 check
10? PF1L
11? PF1R
1?x PF1 check type

y bits:
if 7 -> 3, then
0-6 = line * 2 + 1

=== New EnSys Algo ===

Spawning:

enNX - Next Target, 4x4 grid x
enNY - Next Target, 4x4 grid y

enNX, enNY set to initial spawn pos

Movement:
If thisX,thisY = enNX, enNY; NextDir


=== Generalized Entity Room Collision Check ===

8x8 Entities can only exist on points
x = $04 to $7C
y = $08 to $50

Real world pixel is 4x4, giving us
x = 31 steps player, 27 other
y = 19 steps player, 15 other

x = $20 stradle PF1L, PF2 (test 0th bit for both)
x = $60 stradle PF1R, PF2
x <= $1C is PF1L (bit 7 -> 0)
x >= $24 and <= $5C is PF2 (bit 0 -> 7 -> 0)
x >= $64 is PF1R (bit 0 -> 7)

Start by handling $20, $60 special case
if $20 bit set
    $20 case if v flag not set
    $60 if v flag set
else

Text24 draws 24 characters on a line every 2 frames, but it consumed most of
the rom I budgeted for text, without even storing text in the rom yet. It also
used 24 bytes of ram, which is a ton. when i looked at the code, i discovered
two subroutines, one for frame 1, one for frame 2, which were nearly identical.
The main difference was that one needed a 4 cycle delay while the other needed
a 6 cycle delay to position the sprite data correctly. I was able to
deduplicate the code by using the overflow flag to store whether the delay
should be 4 or 6 cycles long. A branch takes 2 cycles to execute, 3 if the
branch is taken, and so a pair of bvs is enough to implement a variable cycle
delay of 4/6 cycles.


Caves:

Entering an overworld room with a negative id sends you to a cave.
The cave properties are determined by roomEX, which is not clobbered
on entering the cave.

Timing:

Battle algo:

Check if weapon hitbox overlaps enemy hitbox

0, 1, 2, 3, 5

Sword - Direction and Timer
    frames -7 to -2 // same as Arrow
    EW hitbox is 8x2
    NS hitbox is 2x8
    frame -1 // possibly not needed?
    EW hitbox is 4x2
    NS hitbox is 2x4

Bomb - Timer, swap between 4x4 and 8x8 hitbox
Arrow - Direction
    EW hitbox is 8x2
    NS hitbox is 2x8
Fire - Simple 4x4 hitbox
Flute - No Hit
Wand -> Sword then Fire?
Meat - No Hit
Potion - No Hit


Hitbox system:

To test if two boxes AA and BB overlap:
    if AA.x > BB.x - AA.w:
    if AA.x < BB.x + BB.w:
        # x axis pass

Another way to compute it:
    (u8)(AA.x + AA.w-1 - BB.x) < (AA.w + BB.w-1)

Hb_Get_Pl_Att: Fetches current player attack and it's hitbox

Enemy Missile positioning guidelines

mi0X,mi0Y must consistently correlate to plX, plY. Kernel limitations make it
impossible for sprites to align perfectly.

m1x needs to be inc by 1 over mi0X to overlap bottom left player pixel
m1y does not need to be adjusted, but the missle will appear 1 scanline above
